\section{Motion in a Medium} % (fold)
\label{sec:motion_in_a_medium}

In this essay I shall defend and develop The Wave Theory of Sound. The Wave Theory has come on hard times of late---unfairly, to my mind. Many are of the opinion that it is no longer a viable alternative in the metaphysics of sound, and this despite a long and venerable history. As we shall see, many apparent difficulties facing The Wave Theory are due to an exclusive focus on hearing sounds. An exclusive focus on hearing sounds can lead to a distorted conception not only of audition but of the sounds themselves. With respect to audition it can encourage the thought that the function of audition is to afford the perceiver with auditory awareness of sounds. But if we can hear not only sounds, but their sources, understood as sound-generating events, it is more likely that the function of audition is to afford the perceiver awareness of the distal sources of sound. With respect to sound, an exclusive focus on hearing sounds can lead to conflating features of sources of sound with features of the sounds themselves. Many of the recent criticisms of The Wave Theory turn on just such a conflation.

The aim of this essay is not to establish The Wave Theory of Sound from first principles. Rather, in defending and developing The Wave Theory of Sound, I aim only establish that The Wave Theory is a coherent credible alternative to contemporary accounts of the metaphysics of sound. However, as we shall see, defending and developing The Wave Theory of Sound in the way that I shall, suffices to undermine the motivation for an important class of contemporary accounts, the so-called distal conceptions of sound.

\section{Assumptions} % (fold)
\label{sec:section_name}

In defending and developing The Wave Theory of Sound, I shall make a number of assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sounds are particulars.
	\item Sounds are the bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities.
	\item (With Berkeley) if sources are audible, then sources have audible qualities.
	\item Sounds are not the sole bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities; in propitious circumstances, we can hear, as well, their sources (understood as sound-generating events).
	\item The bearers of audible qualities are events, and hence audible qualities are essentially sustained by activity.
\end{enumerate}
Though I cannot here make a full dress defence, allow me to both explain and motivate these insofar as I can.

1. \emph{Sounds are particulars.} That sounds are particulars is a substantive claim, though in some ways a liberal one. Particulars, after all, belong to a range of ontological categories. Thus bodies, events, processes, and quality instances are all particulars, but they have different modes of being and thus belong to different ontological categories. But if particulars belong to a range of ontological categories then the claim that sounds are particulars does not yet determine which ontological category sounds belongs to. Thus while a substantive claim, it is liberal in the sense of being consistent with substantively different metaphysics of sounds. For example, that sounds are particulars is consistent even with a broadly Lockean metaphysics of sound where sounds are qualities of bodies, say, if not necessarily secondary qualities (besides \citealt{Locke:1706hc}, see \citealt{Pasnau:1999ss}, \citealt{Kulvicki:2008aa}, and \citealt{Roberts:2017as}). Hearing is objective. If there is nothing actual heard, then nothing is heard. So if sounds are qualities, then at least in the case of hearing a sound, the sound that you hear must be a quality instance and not an uninstantiated universal. Only instances of universals and not uninstantiated universals are actual in the relevant sense. And if the quality is conceived as a power or disposition, then it must be their manifestation. Only manifestations of powers or dispositions are actual in the relevant sense. So at least with respect to heard sound, our first assumption is consistent with a broadly Lockean metaphysics of sound.

2. \emph{Sounds are the bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities.} Our first assumption may be consistent with a broadly Lockean metaphysics of sound, at least in the case of heard sound, but not so our second assumption, for according to it, when combined with our first assumption, sounds are not qualities, but the particulars that are the bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities. Aristotle, in \emph{De Anima} 2 11 422 b 31--2, endorses this view on phenomenological grounds. It is at least the case that we are inclined to describe our experience of sounds in this way. Thus we say that we can hear a sound getting louder, or its pitch varying over time. Auditory experience seems to present sounds with a dynamic profile of auditory qualities. By our assumptions so far, sounds may be particulars that are the bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible categories, but it remains indeterminate which ontological category these particulars belong to. This will be explicitly addressed in our fifth assumption.

3. \emph{(With Berkeley) if sources are audible, then sources have audible qualities.} According to Berkeley, we hear only sounds. The sources of sounds are, strictly speaking, inaudible. In \emph{Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous}, Berkeley distinguishes sounds from their sources by an application of Leibniz's Law. Sounds have audible qualities that sources lack. Sources, lacking audible qualities, are thereby inaudible. So Berkeley is assuming that if sources are audible, then they have audible qualities. He denies that they have audible qualities and concludes, by \emph{modus tollens}, that sources are inaudible. Equally, however, on may grant Berkeley the conditional and reason instead my \emph{modus ponens}. Doing so would be to assume, as our next assumption does, that sources are audible and conclude that they have audible qualities. What audible qualities could they have? Insofar as it is associated with the material structure of bodies participating in the sound-generating event, timbre is a good candidate. Or if timbre is not a well defined category, if it is understood, in a deflationary fashion, as whatever varies as pitch and volume are held constant, then some natural subcomponent of timbre is a good candidate for being an audible quality of the source understood as a sound-generating event.

4. \emph{Sounds are not the sole bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities; in propitious circumstances, we can hear, as well, their sources (understood as sound-generating events).} I shall assume that we not only hear sounds but, at least in propitious circumstances, their sources as well. We ordinarily speak of bodies and their sound-generating activities indifferently as sources. Bodies are said to be sources insofar as they have the power to sound, to engage in sound-generating activity. However, by source, I shall mean, not a body possessing the power to sound so much as the sound-generating activity it gives rise to. For present purposes I restrict talk fo sources to sound-generating events since plausibly only these, and not bodies, figure in auditory experience (for a defence of this and a partial accommodation of the opposing view see \citealt[chapter 3.4]{Kalderon:2018oe}) Sources, so understood, are sound-generating events. If we hear, not only sounds, but sometimes their sources as well, then sounds are not alone in being the bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities. If we sometimes hear the sources of sound---not just the sound of the door slamming but the door slamming---then the sources of sound are audible. And if they are audible, then they must possess audible qualities. Again, a natural subcomponent of timbre is a good candidate for an audible quality of the sound-generating event.

5. \emph{The bearers of audible qualities are events, and hence audible qualities are essentially sustained by activity.} Sources, in our restricted sense, are events. They are, after all, sound-generating events. But what ontological category do sounds belong to? Are they too events? Insofar as sounds and their sources are the bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities, sounds, like their sources, must be essentially dynamic entities like events. Audible qualities only ever instantiated by things with duration. We can imagine hearing briefer and briefer pitches but we cannot conceive of instantaneous pitch, pitch without duration. Sounds, insofar as they are ausible, essentially have duration then. Not only do they have a beginning and end, like mortal animals and other bodies, but they have a distinctive way of being in time. A sound is not wholly present at each moment of its sounding. Rather, a sound unfolds through the temporal interval of its sounding. Sounds thus have the same temporal mode of being as events (at least as a three-dimensionalist conceives of them, see \citealt{Fine:2006fk}, for criticism see \citealt{Sider:1997fk} and \citealt{Hawthorne:2008uq}). If both sounds and their sources are events, and these are the only bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities, then the bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities belong to a uniform ontological category, they are essentially dynamic entities. Conversely, this reveals something about the nature of audible qualities. Audible qualities are qualities essentially sustained by activity. Some states and qualities are essentially sustained by activity. Thus \citet{Ryle:1949qr} gives the example of keeping the enemy at bay. The enemy being kept at bay is a state of the larger battle but one that requires continuous military activity to sustain. And \citet{kripke72} gives the example of heat and its connection with molecular motion. Heat is a thermal quality, and a sensible quality, but it is a sensible quality that requires molecular activity to sustain. The only bearers of audible qualities present in auditory experience are essentially dynamic entities. Audible qualities are qualities essentially sustained by activity.

\section{Sonic Events} % (fold)
\label{sec:sonic_events}

If sounds are events, then what events are they? Consider the following three candidates:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sounds are events that would cause a patterned disturbance to propagate, in every direction, through a dense and elastic medium should there be one. \citep{Casati:1994aa}
	\item Sounds are the causing of a patterned disturbance to propagate, in every direction, through a dense and elastic medium. \citep{OCallaghan:2007xy}
	\item Sounds are events of rarefaction. Specifically, they are the propagation, in every direction, of a patterned disturbance through a dense and elastic medium. (The Wave Theory, \citealt{OShaughnessy:2009aa}, \citealt{Sorensen:2009aa}, \citealt[chapters 3–4]{Kalderon:2018oe})
\end{enumerate}

\section{Two Models of Sonic Propagation} % (fold)
\label{sec:two_models_of_sonic_propagation}

Plato and Aristotle identify sound with motion in a medium (\emph{Timaeus} 67a–c, 80a–b; \emph{De Anima} 2 8). Though they identify sound with motion in a medium we are still a long way from The Wave Theory as defended herein (see, for example, Cornford's \citeyear[320 n.1]{Cornford:1935fk} criticism of \citealt{Archer-Hind:1888qd}). For one thing, both Plato and Aristotle conceive of the medium being moved as a continuous unity (on this point, in the \emph{Timaeus} account of sound, see \citealt[109]{Beare:1906uq}). Moreover, the view may be differently developed depending upon what, exactly, motion---\emph{kìnêsis}---means. \emph{kìnêsis} is Aristotle's general term for change of any kind, and so not merely locomotion. And though it is not a technical term in Plato's writing the way that it is Aristotle's, a similar usage can be found especially in the \emph{Timaeus}. This is important since \emph{kìnêsis} here could be locomotion, a change of place over time, or it could instead be a species of alteration. These contrasting interpretative hypotheses provide us with two models of sonic propagation.

On the first model, sonic propagation is understood in terms of locomotion. So understood, the patterned disturbance is literally travelling through the dense and elastic medium. Locomotion is a change paradigmatically undergone by bodies. In the case of Plato and Aristotle, the relevant bodies would be continuous bodies of air produced by a sharp percussive blow. However, since we are assuming that sounds are events and not bodies, does that mean that the model is inapplicable from the start? The issue is unobvious since events have locations, though perhaps not in the way that bodies do (see, for example, \citealt{Davidson:1969da}) And, sometimes at least, events change their locations over time. Thus the fight started in the bar and spilled into the street, and the conga line started in the dining room and wound its way into the living room. Still, if it is specifically the patterned disturbance that is in ``motion'', and not the dense and elastic medium that instantiates the patterned disturbance, then the propagation of the patterned disturbance is better understood as a species of alteration.

For this reason, Prichard denies that waves and sounds, being what they are, are subject to locomotion. Only bodies move, and waves and sounds are not bodies:
\begin{quotation}
	But \dots\ I also made the same remark (viz.\ that only a body could move) to a mathematician here. What was in my mind was that it is mere inaccuracy to say that a wave could move, and that where people talk of a wave as moving, say with the velocity of a foot, or a mile, or 150,000 miles, a second, the real movement consisted of the oscillations of certain particles, each of which took place a little later than a neighbouring oscillation.
	
	He scoffed for quite a different reason. He said that you could illustrate a movement by a noise---that, for example, if an explosion occurred in the middle of Oxford the noise would spread outwards, being heard at different times by people at varying distances from the centre, so that at one moment the noise was at one place and that a little later it was somewhere else, and in the interval it had moved from one place to the other.
	
	Now, of course, it was not in dispute that in the process imagined people in different places each heard a noise at a rather different time. The only question was, `Was the succession of noises a movement?', and I think that on considering the matter you will have to allow that it was not, and that what happened was that he, being certain of the noises, and wanting to limit the term `movement' to something he was certain of, used the term `movement' to designate the succession of noises, implying that this was the real thing of which we were both talking. But if this is what happened, then he was using the term `movement' in a sense of his own, and in saying that in the imagined case he was certain of a movement, he was being certain of something other than the opposite of what I was certain of. \citep[99]{Prichard:1950kx}
\end{quotation}
\citet[430 n. 29, appendix,]{Burnyeat:1995fk} lampoons Aristotle for making similar claims by citing Prichard echoing them here. I have argued, that at least in this instance, Burnyeat is hoisted by his own petard, \citep[chapter 3.2]{Kalderon:2015fr}. If Prichard is right, then sonic propagation cannot be understood in terms of locomotion.

On the second model, sonic propagation is understood, not in terms of locomotion, but in terms of alteration. So understood, sonic propagation is a kind of dynamic in-formation. Specifically, the patterned disturbance is successively in-forming differently located parts of the dense and elastic medium along a rectilinear path in a direction away from the source of the sound. Thus the source's sounding will initially produce a patterned disturbance in the dense and elastic medium adjacent to the source. At a later moment, the patterned disturbance will be instanced by a different part of the dense and elastic medium, further away from the source along a rectilinear path. On this model, the patterned disturbance is not travelling, at least not literally. It is not the case that the patterned disturbance is now located here and now there, at least not directly. Rather, differently located parts of the dense and elastic medium come to successively instantiate the patterned disturbance. A change of state and travel are distinct (\emph{De Sensu} 6 446 b 28).

\begin{quote}
	But the noise is not literally heard as the occurrence of a certain sound-quality within a limited region remote from the percipient's body. It certainly is not heard as having any shape or size. It seems to be heard as coming to one from a certain direction, and it seems to be thought of as pervading with various degrees of intensity the whole of an indefinitely large region surrounding the centre from which it emanates. \citep[5]{Broad:1952kx}
