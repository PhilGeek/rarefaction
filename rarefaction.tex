\section{Motion in a Medium} % (fold)
\label{sec:motion_in_a_medium}

In this essay I shall defend and develop The Wave Theory of Sound. The Wave Theory has come on hard times of late---unfairly, to my mind. Many are of the opinion that it is no longer a viable alternative in the metaphysics of sound, and this despite a long and venerable history. As we shall see, many apparent difficulties facing The Wave Theory are due to an exclusive focus on hearing sounds. An exclusive focus on hearing sounds can lead to a distorted conception not only of audition but of the sounds themselves. With respect to audition it can encourage the thought that the function of audition is to afford the perceiver with auditory awareness of sounds. But if we can hear not only sounds, but their sources, understood as sound-generating events, it is more likely that the function of audition is to afford the perceiver awareness of the distal sources of sound. With respect to sound, an exclusive focus on hearing sounds can lead to conflating features of sources of sound with features of the sounds themselves. Many of the recent criticisms of The Wave Theory turn on just such a conflation.

The aim of this essay is not to establish The Wave Theory of Sound from first principles. Rather, in defending and developing The Wave Theory of Sound, I aim only establish that The Wave Theory is a coherent credible alternative to contemporary accounts of the metaphysics of sound. However, as we shall see, defending and developing The Wave Theory of Sound in the way that I shall, undermines the motivation for an important class of contemporary accounts, the so-called distal conceptions of sound.

\section{Assumptions} % (fold)
\label{sec:section_name}

In defending and developing The Wave Theory of Sound, I shall make a number of assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sounds are particulars.
	\item Sounds are the bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities.
	\item (With Berkeley) if sources are audible, then sources have audible qualities.
	\item Sounds are not the sole bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities; in propitious circumstances, we can hear, as well, their sources (understood as sound-generating events).
	\item The bearers of audible qualities are events, and hence audible qualities are essentially sustained by activity.
\end{enumerate}
Though I cannot here make a full dress defence, allow me to both explain and motivate these insofar as I can.

1. \emph{Sounds are particulars.} That sounds are particulars is a substantive claim, though in some ways a liberal one. Particulars, after all, belong to a range of ontological categories. Thus bodies, events, processes, and quality instances are all particulars, but they have different modes of being and thus belong to different ontological categories. But if particulars belong to a range of ontological categories then the claim that sounds are particulars does not yet determine which ontological category sounds belongs to. Thus while a substantive claim, it is liberal in the sense of being consistent with substantively different metaphysics of sounds. For example, that sounds are particulars is consistent even with a broadly Lockean metaphysics of sound where sounds are qualities of bodies, say, if not necessarily secondary qualities (besides \citealt{Locke:1706hc}, see \citealt{Pasnau:1999ss}, \citealt{Kulvicki:2008aa}, and \citealt{Roberts:2017as}). Hearing is objective. If there is nothing actual heard, then nothing is heard. So if sounds are qualities, then at least in the case of hearing a sound, the sound that you hear must be a quality instance and not an uninstantiated universal. Only instances of universals and not uninstantiated universals are actual in the relevant sense. And if the quality is conceived as a power or disposition, then it must be their manifestation. Only manifestations of powers or dispositions are actual in the relevant sense. So at least with respect to heard sound, our first assumption is consistent with a broadly Lockean metaphysics of sound.

2. \emph{Sounds are the bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities.} Our first assumption may be consistent with a broadly Lockean metaphysics of sound, at least in the case of heard sound, but not so our second assumption, for according to it, when combined with our first assumption, sounds are not qualities, but the particulars that are the bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities. Aristotle, in \emph{De Anima} 2 11 422 b 31--2, endorses this view on phenomenological grounds. It is at least the case that we are inclined to describe our experience of sounds in this way. Thus we say that we can hear a sound getting louder, or its pitch varying over time. Auditory experience seems to present sounds with a dynamic profile of auditory qualities. By our assumptions so far, sounds may be particulars that are the bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible categories, but it remains indeterminate which ontological category these particulars belong to. This will be explicitly addressed in our fifth assumption.

3. \emph{(With Berkeley) if sources are audible, then sources have audible qualities.} According to Berkeley, we hear only sounds. The sources of sounds are, strictly speaking, inaudible. In \emph{Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous}, Berkeley distinguishes sounds from their sources by an application of Leibniz's Law. Sounds have audible qualities that sources lack. Sources, lacking audible qualities, are thereby inaudible. So Berkeley is assuming that if sources are audible, then they have audible qualities. He denies that they have audible qualities and concludes, by \emph{modus tollens}, that sources are inaudible. Equally, however, on may grant Berkeley the conditional and reason instead my \emph{modus ponens}. Doing so would be to assume, as our next assumption does, that sources are audible and conclude that they have audible qualities. What audible qualities could they have? Insofar as it is associated with the material structure of bodies participating in the sound-generating event, timbre is a good candidate. Or if timbre is not a well defined category, if it is understood, in a deflationary fashion, as whatever varies as pitch and volume are held constant, then some natural subcomponent of timbre is a good candidate for being an audible quality of the source understood as a sound-generating event.

4. \emph{Sounds are not the sole bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities; in propitious circumstances, we can hear, as well, their sources (understood as sound-generating events).} I shall assume that we not only hear sounds but, at least in propitious circumstances, their sources as well. We ordinarily speak of bodies and their sound-generating activities indifferently as sources. Bodies are said to be sources insofar as they have the power to sound, to engage in sound-generating activity. However, by source, I shall mean, not a body possessing the power to sound so much as the sound-generating activity it gives rise to. For present purposes I restrict talk fo sources to sound-generating events since plausibly only these, and not bodies, figure in auditory experience (for a defence of this and a partial accommodation of the opposing view see \citealt[chapter 3.4]{Kalderon:2018oe}) Sources, so understood, are sound-generating events. If we hear, not only sounds, but sometimes their sources as well, then sounds are not alone in being the bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities. If we sometimes hear the sources of sound---not just the sound of the door slamming but the door slamming---then the sources of sound are audible. And if they are audible, then they must possess audible qualities. Again, a natural subcomponent of timbre is a good candidate for an audible quality of the sound-generating event.

5. \emph{The bearers of audible qualities are events, and hence audible qualities are essentially sustained by activity.} Sources, in our restricted sense, are events. They are, after all, sound-generating events. But what ontological category do sounds belong to? Are they too events? Insofar as sounds and their sources are the bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities, sounds, like their sources, must be essentially dynamic entities like events. Audible qualities only ever instantiated by things with duration. We can imagine hearing briefer and briefer pitches but we cannot conceive of instantaneous pitch, pitch without duration. Sounds, insofar as they are audible, essentially have duration then. Not only do they have a beginning and end, like mortal animals and other bodies, but they have a distinctive way of being in time. A sound is not wholly present at each moment of its sounding. Rather, a sound unfolds through the temporal interval of its sounding. Sounds thus have the same temporal mode of being as events (at least as a three-dimensionalist conceives of them, see \citealt{Fine:2006fk}, for criticism see \citealt{Sider:1997fk} and \citealt{Hawthorne:2008uq}). If both sounds and their sources are events, and these are the only bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities, then the bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities belong to a uniform ontological category, they are essentially dynamic entities. Conversely, this reveals something about the nature of audible qualities. Audible qualities are qualities essentially sustained by activity. Some states and qualities are essentially sustained by activity. Thus \citet{Ryle:1949qr} gives the example of keeping the enemy at bay. The enemy being kept at bay is a state of the larger battle, a stable phase of it, but one that requires military activity to sustain. And \citet{kripke72} gives the example of heat and its connection with molecular motion. Heat is a thermal quality, and a sensible quality, but it is a sensible quality that requires molecular activity to sustain. The only bearers of audible qualities present in auditory experience are essentially dynamic entities. While a thesis about the kind of particulars that can be present in auditory experience, when coupled with our assumption that these particulars are the bearers or \emph{substrata} of audible qualities, it has consequences for the nature of audible qualities. If audible qualities only ever inhere in essentially dynamic entities, then they are qualities essentially sustained by activity.

\section{Sonic Events} % (fold)
\label{sec:sonic_events}

If sounds are events, then what events are they? Consider the following three candidates:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sounds are events that would cause a patterned disturbance to propagate, in every direction, through a dense and elastic medium should there be one. \citep{Casati:1994aa}
	\item Sounds are the causing of a patterned disturbance to propagate, in every direction, through a dense and elastic medium. \citep{OCallaghan:2007xy}
	\item Sounds are events of rarefaction. Specifically, they are the propagation, in every direction, of a patterned disturbance through a dense and elastic medium. (The Wave Theory, \citealt{OShaughnessy:2009aa}, \citealt{Sorensen:2009aa}, \citealt[chapters 3–4]{Kalderon:2018oe})
\end{enumerate}
Our three candidate events have a number of elements in common. It is unsurprising that they do given that they are related, if distinct, events. What then are their common elements? The patterned disturbance consists in longitudinal compression waves that vary in amplitude and frequency. These occur in a dense and elastic medium, be it air or water or some other suitable material. Moreover, the patterned disturbance is propagating, in every direction, from its source. The force with which the patterned disturbance propagates diffuses through the dense and elastic medium. And as Bacon observes, this is characteristic of events of rarefaction.

The first candidate event, one that would cause a patterned disturbance to propagate, in every direction, through a dense and elastic medium should there be one, is existentially independent of the medium. It is also heterogenous. It is the bowing, grinding, scraping, vibrating, resonating, whatever kind of event that would cause a patterned disturbance to propagate, in every direction, through a dense and elastic medium should there be one. But these events could occur even in the absence of such a medium.

The second candidate event, the causing of the patterned disturbance to propagate, in every direction, through a dense and elastic medium, is not existentially independent of the medium nor is it heterogenous. The event of causing a patterned disturbance to propagate through a dense and elastic medium could only occur if there were such a medium. The second candidate event existentially depends upon the medium. The causing of a patterned disturbance to propagate through a medium has a more unified structure then the bowing, grinding, scraping, vibrating, and so on. Though these would be causings of a patterned disturbance to propagate, in every direction, through a dense and elastic medium should they occur in such medium.

The third candidate event, like the second, existentially depends upon the medium. According to The Wave Theory, at least as developed herein, sounds are not patterned disturbances so much as they are the propagation, in every direction, of a patterned disturbance, through a dense and elastic medium. Such events could only occur if a suitable medium exists. Like the second candidate, the third candidate has a unified structure and so is not heterogenous. The unified structure of the third candidate is less abstract and more dynamic than the unified structure of the second candidate. As Bacon observed, it has the characteristic structure of an event of rarefaction. The force with which the patterned disturbance propagates diffuses through the dense and elastic medium. And diffusion occurs along rectilinear paths from the center to the expanding circumference of a sphere. Assuming the medium is perfectly elastic, and ignoring density, and potential obstructors of sound, we can envision the event of rarefaction as an ever expanding sphere, the patterned disturbance occurring at the outer boundary of the expanding sphere. Neither the first nor the second candidate events display the dynamic structure of an event of rarefaction.

\section{Two Models of Sonic Propagation} % (fold)
\label{sec:two_models_of_sonic_propagation}

Plato and Aristotle identify sound with motion in a medium (\emph{Timaeus} 67a–c, 80a–b; \emph{De Anima} 2 8). Though they identify sound with motion in a medium we are still a long way from The Wave Theory as defended herein (see, for example, Cornford's \citeyear[320 n.1]{Cornford:1935fk} criticism of \citealt{Archer-Hind:1888qd}). For one thing, both Plato and Aristotle conceive of the medium being moved as a continuous unity (on this point, in the \emph{Timaeus} account of sound, see \citealt[109]{Beare:1906uq}). Moreover, the view may be differently developed depending upon what, exactly, motion---\emph{kìnêsis}---means. \emph{kìnêsis} is Aristotle's general term for change of any kind, and so not merely locomotion. And though it is not a technical term in Plato's writing the way that it is Aristotle's, a similar usage can be found especially in the \emph{Timaeus}. This is important since \emph{kìnêsis} here could be locomotion, a change of place over time, or it could instead be a species of alteration. These contrasting interpretative hypotheses provide us with two models of sonic propagation.

On the first model, sonic propagation is understood in terms of locomotion. So understood, the patterned disturbance is literally travelling through the dense and elastic medium. Locomotion is a change paradigmatically undergone by bodies. In the case of Plato and Aristotle, the relevant bodies would be continuous bodies of air produced by a sharp percussive blow. However, since we are assuming that sounds are events and not bodies, does that mean that the model is inapplicable from the start? The issue is unobvious since events have locations, though perhaps not in the way that bodies do (see, for example, \citealt{Davidson:1969da}) And, sometimes at least, events change their locations over time. Thus the fight started in the bar and spilled into the street, and the conga line started in the dining room and wound its way into the living room. Still, if it is specifically the patterned disturbance that is in ``motion'', and not the dense and elastic medium that instantiates the patterned disturbance, then the propagation of the patterned disturbance is better understood as a species of alteration.

For this reason, Prichard denies that waves and sounds, being what they are, are subject to locomotion. Only bodies move, and waves and sounds are not bodies:
\begin{quotation}
	But \dots\ I also made the same remark (viz.\ that only a body could move) to a mathematician here. What was in my mind was that it is mere inaccuracy to say that a wave could move, and that where people talk of a wave as moving, say with the velocity of a foot, or a mile, or 150,000 miles, a second, the real movement consisted of the oscillations of certain particles, each of which took place a little later than a neighbouring oscillation.
	
	He scoffed for quite a different reason. He said that you could illustrate a movement by a noise---that, for example, if an explosion occurred in the middle of Oxford the noise would spread outwards, being heard at different times by people at varying distances from the centre, so that at one moment the noise was at one place and that a little later it was somewhere else, and in the interval it had moved from one place to the other.
	
	Now, of course, it was not in dispute that in the process imagined people in different places each heard a noise at a rather different time. The only question was, `Was the succession of noises a movement?', and I think that on considering the matter you will have to allow that it was not, and that what happened was that he, being certain of the noises, and wanting to limit the term `movement' to something he was certain of, used the term `movement' to designate the succession of noises, implying that this was the real thing of which we were both talking. But if this is what happened, then he was using the term `movement' in a sense of his own, and in saying that in the imagined case he was certain of a movement, he was being certain of something other than the opposite of what I was certain of. \citep[99]{Prichard:1950kx}
\end{quotation}
\citet[430 n. 29, appendix,]{Burnyeat:1995fk} lampoons Aristotle for making similar claims by citing Prichard echoing them here. I have argued, that at least in this instance, Burnyeat is hoisted by his own petard, \citep[chapter 3.2]{Kalderon:2015fr}. If Prichard is right, then sonic propagation cannot be understood in terms of locomotion.

On the second model, sonic propagation is understood, not in terms of locomotion, but in terms of alteration. So understood, sonic propagation is a kind of dynamic in-formation. Specifically, the patterned disturbance is successively in-forming differently located parts of the dense and elastic medium along a rectilinear path in a direction away from the source of the sound. Thus the source's sounding will initially produce a patterned disturbance in the dense and elastic medium adjacent to the source. At a later moment, the patterned disturbance will be instanced by a different part of the dense and elastic medium, further away from the source along a rectilinear path. On this model, the patterned disturbance is not travelling, at least not literally. It is not the case that the patterned disturbance is now located here and now there, at least not directly. Rather, differently located parts of the dense and elastic medium come to successively instantiate the patterned disturbance. A change of state and travel are distinct (\emph{De Sensu} 6 446 b 28). Of course the dynamic in-formation is materially realized by the motions of bodies, but as Prichard observes, the only bodies in motion are ``the oscillation of certain particles'', the force with which the patterned disturbance propagates being communicated from one oscillating particle to the next. The propagation of the patterned disturbance in the event of rarefaction shall be understood as a dynamic in-formation, not a kind of locomotion so much as a kind of alteration.

\section{Motive and Objections} % (fold)
\label{sec:motive_and_objections}


Why identify sounds with events of rarefaction? What recommends The Wave Theory of Sound? The Wave Theory, or historical variants of it, have traditionally been motivated on phenomenological grounds. Broad nicely captures the emanative phenomenology of auditory experience that motivates The Wave Theory of Sound, in contrasting auditory experience of sound with visual experience of color:
\begin{quote}
	But the noise is not literally heard as the occurrence of a certain sound-quality within a limited region remote from the percipient's body. It certainly is not heard as having any shape or size. It seems to be heard as coming to one from a certain direction, and it seems to be thought of as pervading with various degrees of intensity the whole of an indefinitely large region surrounding the centre from which it emanates. \citep[5]{Broad:1952kx}
\end{quote}
Colors are seen to inhere in surfaces of bodies located at a distance from the perceiver's body. Colors are only ever inhere in spatially extended things and have the shapes of the extend things in which they inhere. But that is not how audition presents the sounds that we hear. Sounds are not experienced as qualties confined to a region remote from the perceiver, rather sounds are heard to come to one from their sources. This is the emanative aspect of auditory phenomenology. Broad, in addition, emphasizes the pervasiveness of sound: ``it seems to be thought of as pervading with various degrees of intensity the whole of an indefinitely large region surrounding the centre from which it emanates''. As we shall see, there is an issue as to how pervasiveness should best be interpreted. 

The emanative phenomenology of audition naturally motivates The Wave Theory of Sound. For suppose that auditory experience does, in fact, have an emanative phenomenology, and that this aspect of our auditory experience is veridical, then in hearing sounds emanating from their sources would just be to hear an event of rarefaction. The direction from which the sound is coming is just the direction of the force with which the patterned disturbance propagates as it diffuses through the dense and elastic medium. Now Broad himself does not accept The Wave Theory of Sound because he does not accept that the emanative phenomenology of auditory experience is veridical. The sharp phenomenological differences between the senses that he observes are all undermined by the common causal mechanisms that underly the operation of the senses and are at least misleading if not indeed illusory. 

I shall consider two kinds of objections to the wave theory. One seeks to undermine the phenomenological motivation of The Wave Theory, the other seeks to draw are attention to aspects of the phenomenology of auditory experience that are allegedly inconsistent with The Wave Theory.

Here is O’Callaghan pressing the fist kind of objection:
\begin{quote}
	It might be that sounds are heard to come from a particular place by being heard first to be at that place, and then to be at successively closer intermediate locations. But this is not the case with ordinary hearing. Sounds are not heard to travel through the air as scientists have taught us that waves do. \citep[34]{OCallaghan:2007xy}
\end{quote}
Notice that O’Callaghan is understanding the motion of a medium as a species of locomotion, as change of place over time. But the propagation of a patterned disturbance is better understood as a dynamic in-formation. Not the wave-form changing its location over time so much as differently located things, different parts of the medium, successively instantiating the wave-form. 

If O’Callaghan’s objection focused on one aspect of the phenomenological motivation for The Wave Theory—that sounds are heard to come from their sources, Pasnau’s objection is focused on another aspect of the phenomenological motivation—that sounds are heard to pervade a volume. Sounds are not heard to audibly fill a medium except in exceptional cases.

Pasnau claims that most sounds do not audibly fill the medium. So filling the medium must be something audibly accessible. Consider a brief sound, such as a call of one of London's feral parakeets. According to The Wave Theory, the sound is the propagation, in every direction, of a patterned disturbance through a medium. In one clear sense, the only audible aspect of this complex event is the patterned disturbance as it is through some interval of time. The outer boundary of the sphere, the narrow band which is the patterned disturbance, is audible in the sense of being a potential proximal cause of the auditory experience of the sound. So while the complex event may be envisioned as a growing sphere, since the sound is brief, the only audible aspect of the sound is at the moving boundary of the sphere, the narrow band which is the patterned disturbance. After all, if a perceiver is placed within the sphere between the source of the sound and the narrow band at the sphere's outer boundary, they are no longer in a position to hear the sound. 

In one clear sense that may be so, but there are other, relevant senses of audibility. So, if circumstances are propitious, we can hear the direction of the sound's propagation. We may even have a sense of how far off the source is. So aspects of the complex sound event are in another relevant sense audible and in that they are not merely confined to the patterned disturbance at the outer boundary of the sphere. Nor are these exceptional cases. 

The Wave Theory is only committed to sounds being heard to fill the air in this latter sense. In this sense, something is audible if it is heard in hearing a sound. Of course, even on the first sense of audible, understood as a potential proximal cause of the perception of the sound, a continuous sound, such as a sound of a waterfall, will audibly fill the air---the continuously produced patterned disturbances will pervade the space between the perceiver and its source. But as Pasnau observes, and The Wave Theory predicts, these are exceptional cases.

Pasnau not only presses the first kind of objection but also the second kind. That is, he objects not only to The Wave Theory’s phenomenological motivation, but maintains as well that there are aspects of the phenomenology of auditory experience that are inconsistent with it:
\begin{quote}
	We do not hear sounds as being in the air; we hear them as being at the place where they are generated. Listening to the birds outside your win- dow, the students outside your door, the cars going down your street, in the vast majority of cases you will perceive those sounds as being located at the place where they originate. At least, you will hear those sounds as being located somewhere in the distance, in a certain general direction. But if sounds are in the air, as the standard view holds, then the cries of birds and of students are all around you. This is not how it seems (except perhaps in special cases ...). 
\end{quote}

Pasnau's argument has two parts:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A claim about where sounds are when we hear them if The Wave Theory is true.
	\item A claim that our auditory experience includes a distal element.
\end{enumerate}
For now bracket the fist claim, and consider only the second (we shall subsequently return to the issue of where the sounds would be if The Wave Theory were true). When one listens to the birds outside one’s window, the students outside one’s door, and the cars going down one’s street, what is it that one is listening to? A flat-footed answer would be, well, birds, students, and cars, or at least their audible activities. But birds, students, and cars, or at least their activities, while audible, are not themselves sounds but their sources, at least potentially. If we hear not only sounds, but their sources, then discovering a distal element in auditory experience is not sufficient to establish that the sounds that we hear are themselves distal. After all the distal element may be the presentation in auditory experience of not the sound but its source.

Another objection of the second kind that conflates sounds with their sources is O’Callgahan’s \citeyearpar[89]{OCallaghan:2007xy} argument from timbre. O’Callaghan argues that auditory constancies concerning timbre favor thinking of the sounds that we hear as the causing of the propagation of a patterned disturbance, as opposed to the propagation of the patterned disturbance, as The Wave Theory contends. If timbre, or some natural subcomponent of it, were an audible quality of sound, then this would favor thinking of sound as the causing of the propagation of a patterned disturbance. Timbre is an audible quality, to be sure, but is it best thought of as an audible quality of sound? The conclusion that O’Callaghan draws from Handel’s research---that timbre depends, at least in part, upon features of the source and the characteristic manner in which it disturbs the medium---suggests, instead, that timbre is better understood as an audible quality of the sound’s source, the sound-generating event.

In an intellectual context, such as our own, where it is controversial what sounds are, how plausible is it to rely on the the distinction between sounds and their sources? After all, if sounds are up for grabs, isn’t the distinction between sounds and their sources up for grabs as well? What ought not to be controversial is that there are sound-generating events. While it may be controversial whether sound-generating events are audible, some latter-day Berkeleans such as A.D. Smith \citeyearpar{Smith:2002sa} deny it, it should be uncontroversial that such events exist. Which events they are will depend, of course, upon what sounds are since these events are the causes of sound, but it should be uncontroversial that there are such sources. But even allowing that the identification of an event as the cause of sound will depend upon the controversial issue of what sounds are, there are still things that we can conclude about sources, for example, that they can be at a distance from the perceiver, and that they have audible qualities if heard. Moreover, these conclusions about sources, if warranted, together with the claim that sources are audible, might legitimately ground the lines of criticism presently pursued. 

Where is the event of rarefaction? Its location is an occasion-sensitive matter (in Travis' \citeyear{Travis:2008la} sense). On some occasions, in some practical circumstances, the location of the event of rarefaction is perceiver-dependent. Sounds are located where they hear them (\citealt{Nudds:2009sf}, \citealt{OShaughnessy:2009aa}). On other occasions, in other practical circumstances, a perceiver-independent location of sound is required. Perhaps no perceiver is relevant, or perhaps there is no perceiver of the sound at all. In such circumstances where should the sound be located? We cannot locate sounds in the region encompassed by their boundaries as they lack stable and determinate boundaries, and given the neat symmetry of the event, the patterned disturbance propagating in very direction from its source, it is natural to locate them at their center, at or near their source (see Sorenson's \citeyear{Sorensen:2009aa} analogy with earthquakes, another kind of event of rarefaction).

\section{The Event of Rarefaction} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_event_of_rarefaction}

According to The Wave Theory, as developed herein, the propagation of a patterned disturbance, in every direction, through a dense and elastic medium is the progressive instantiation of a wave-form, a kind of dynamic in-formation, realized by the motion of the local parts of the medium, the oscillation of certain particles. Though the sound event may be said to have location, the propagation of the patterned disturbance through a dense and elastic medium is not best modelled on the locomotion of a body, like a sonic missile. As O’Callaghan observes, that is not how auditory experience presents sound as coming from its source. It is rather better understood as a kind of dynamic in-formation. Sounds are heard to come from their sources in the sense that the direction of the propagation of the patterned disturbance in the growth of the sound event is disclosed in auditory experience. 

As a dynamic in-formation, the sound event has a kind of unity irreducible to the motion of the local parts of the in-formed medium. Conceiving of the propagation of sound on the model of the locomotion of a body—a sonic missile—mistakes the unity of the sound event for the unity of a body. Sound events may lack the unity of a body. After all, events and bodies have different modes of being. But sound events nevertheless possess sufficient unity to distinguish them from the in-formed medium that they existentially depend upon. It is a dynamic unity. It is the force with which the patterned disturbance propagates in every direction that explains the growth of the sound event. While the sound event may be realized by the motion of the local parts of the medium, the oscillation of certain particles, it is the force of its propagation, communicated from one part to the next, that determines the dynamic in-formation. The sound event is realized by the motion of the local parts of the medium without reducing to such motion because of its dynamic unity, the force with which it grows in the dense and imperfectly elastic medium. And it is the direction of this force that is disclosed, more or less clearly, in the emanative phenomenology of auditory experience.
